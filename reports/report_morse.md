## Introduction:
The purpose of this report is to discuss the implementation of Morse potential as  an interatomic potential
in the system of Argon. The goal of the project was to understand the behavior of Argon atoms and molecules
in different forces by simulating their interactions (here using Morse potential).
In this report, I will discuss the implementation process and the results obtained from the simulations.

## Background:
Morse potential is an interatomic potential that is used to describe the interactions   between  atoms  and 
molecules as Van del Waals interactions. It is a more accurate model than other potentials like the  lenard
jones potential, as it takes into account the anharmonicity of the  interatomic interactions. Therefore, it 
is more used in various scientific fields like physics, chemistry, and materials science.

## Methodology:
 The implementation process involved considering a shift in potential energy in a way that energy and force
 at cutoff becomes zero. There are three parameters for Morse potential energy, which can be  derived  from 
 lenard jones constant as well.

To implement Morse potential, I am adding to  the existing  molecular  dynamic  code to  include  the Morse 
potential equations for calculating the energy and force between atoms by considering a force flag `fflag` 
in input file `argon_108.inp`. I considered 0 for lenard jones potential and 1 for Morse potential. In this
way, we can compile once and based on needs use different force fields.
We also added a shift in potential energy to ensure that the energy and force at cutoff became zero.
Morse potential is called by this formula: `V(r) = D*(1-exp(-a*(r-r0)))^2`. Although this version  is  used
for investigation of bond features, here I used the smooth version:
`V(r) = D * (exp(-a*dr)*exp(-a*dr) - 2.0*exp(-a*dr)) - phi_rcut`. This formula comes from taylor  expantion
of `phi = D * (exp(-a*dr)*exp(-a*dr) - 2.0*exp(-a*dr))` around r_cut.

            double rsq = rx*rx + ry*ry + rz*rz;  //remove the expensive sqrt() function from the inner loop

            /* compute force and energy if within cutoff */
           if (rsq < rcsq) {
                /*force between 2 atoms */   
                r = sqrt(rsq); //remove the expensive sqrt() function from the inner loop
                dr = r - r0;   // define dr
                double dexp = exp(-a*dr); 
                double morse1 = 2.0*D*a; //introduce morse1 coefficient
                double alpha_dr = -a * (rcut - r0);  //introduce alpha_dr
                double phi_rcut  = D * (exp(2.0*alpha_dr) - 2.0*exp(alpha_dr)); //the energy at the cutoff radius
                double der_at_cutoff = -2.0*a*D * (exp(2.0*alpha_dr) - exp(alpha_dr)); //the derivative at the cutoff radius

                double fpartial = morse1*(dexp*dexp - dexp) / r;  //introduce fpartial, which is the force at the cutoff radius
                double ffac = D * ( fpartial + der_at_cutoff / r);  
        
                /*morse energy pair wise*/  
                sys->epot = D * (dexp*dexp - 2.0*dexp) - phi_rcut;  // the energy at the cutoff radius is subtracted to avoid double counting
                dr = rcut - r;  // redefine dr, since the energy at the cutoff radius is subtracted
                sys->epot += dr * der_at_cutoff; //adding the energy at the cutoff radius to the energy at the current distance

The gtest fucntion was coded accordingly.

## Results:
The Morse potential was a more accurate model than lenard jones potential, as it took  into  account  the 
anharmonicity of the interatomic interactions.
It needs some consideration based of taylor expantion and a shift in energy and force. Without  the  shift,
the simulations showed that the system was unstable, and the atoms and molecules were not able to maintain
their positions. However, with the shift, the system was stable, and the atoms and molecules were  able to 
maintain their positions.

## Conclusion:
The simulations showed that Morse potential is a more accurate model than lenard jones  potential,  as  it
takes into account the anharmonicity of  the interatomic interactions.The shift  in  potential  energy  is 
also essential for ensuring the stability of  the system. This  project  has  provided  us  with  valuable 
insights into the behavior of atoms and molecules, which can be used to develop more accurate  models  for
simulating their interactions.
